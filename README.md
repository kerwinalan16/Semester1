This project mimics a school system where I use OOP concepts. Students are able to add and drop courses, and biew the courses that they are curently apart of. Courses store information such as the ID and name where it is translated into title case. There are multiple classes that work together, with lombock used to generate essentials like getters and setters to keep the code clean. Unit tests are also used to make sure methods work properly.
